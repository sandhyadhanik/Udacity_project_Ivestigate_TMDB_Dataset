# Udacity_project_Ivestigate_TMDB_Dataset

## Investigate A Dataset 

### Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed a dataset and then communicated my findings about it. 
I used the Python libraries 
* NumPy
* pandas 
* Matplotlib 
In this project, I went through the data analysis process to see how everything fits together. 

### What I learned?
After completing the project I learned the following:

* Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
* Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
* Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
* Have experience communicating the results of your analysis
* Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
* Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
* Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings
